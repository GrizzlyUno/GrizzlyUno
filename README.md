# About
Greetings, 
I am an aspiring (Game) Developer, currently working on a Project called Panorama. 
My journey into Game Development itself started back in the year 2018 when I started building within the Roblox Studio Engine.
Later in the year 2021 led to an interest in Animation, and then from late to mid-2023 into Scripting/Programming.

As mentioned before at the moment, I am working on a game called Panorama, Panorama is a personal endeavor I have taken upon myself to advance my scripting knowledge. 
It is a Murder Mystery game where the Player has to figure out the Mysterious figure behind a series of acts of crime, the game aims to give the user, full mobility to explore the game and solve the mysteries as he feels fit.
Panorama was the stepping stone to expanding my knowledge of scripting a rather rapid paste some of my peers would say.
Within 2-3 months, I've already completed a series of Systems for Panorama.
